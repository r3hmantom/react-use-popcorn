# usePopcorn - Movie Rating App

usePopcorn is a web application built using React, TypeScript, and Vite, allowing users to search for movies, rate them from 1 through 10, and manage their watched movies. The app fetches movie data using the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) and stores watched movies in the local storage of the user's browser. This project was inspired and designed by Jonas Schmedtmann.
